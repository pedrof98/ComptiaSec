# Security Controls Overview

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures implemented to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets.
Understanding the various types of security controls is critical to maintaining robust security practices within any enterprise environment.


# Categories of Security Controls

## Technical Controls

These are security measures implemented using technology.

    - Examples:
        - Firewalls
        - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
        - Antivirus Software
        - Encryption technologies
        - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)



## Managerial Controls

Managerial controls involve administrative methods and policies to manage the selection, implementation, and assessment of security measures.

    - Examples:
        - Security policies
        - Security training programs
        - Risk assessments
        - Regular audits
        - Incident response plans


## Operational Controls

Operational controls are practices and procedures employed by personnel to maintain security on a day-to-day basis.

    - Examples:
        - Security training and awareness
        - Incident response planning
        - Change management processes
        - Regular audits and assessments



## Physical Controls

Physical controls restrict physical access to IT systems and facilities.

    - Examples:
        - Locks
        - Security Guards
        - CCTV cameras
        - Acess control vestibules (mantraps)
        - Environmental controls (HVAC, fire supression)




# Security Control Types and Functions


## Preventive Controls

Preventive controls proactively prevent security breaches or incidents.

    - Examples:
        - Firewalls
        - Security training
        - Hardening systems
        - Access controls


## Deterrent Controls

Deterrent controls are designed to discourage potential attackers by suggesting consequences.

    - Examples:
        - Security signage
        - Surveillance cameras
        - Visible security guards
        - Warning banners on login screens


## Detective Controls

Detective controls identify and alert on security incidents as they occur.

    - Examples:
        - Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
        - Security information and event management systems (SIEM)
        - Logs and audit trails
        - Security alarms


## Corrective Controls

Corrective controls aim to fix or restore systems to normal after a security incident.

    - Examples:
        - Incident response teams
        - Backups and restores
        - Patch management processes


## Compensating Controls

Compensating controls provide alternative solutions when primary controls are not feasible.

    - Examples:
        - Enhanced monitoring when encryption cannot be used
        - Temporary firewall rules until patches are applied



## Directive Controls

Directive controls direct or guide behavior through policies or regulations.

    - Examples:
        - Security policies
        - Procedures
        - Guidelines and standards



## Practical Implications

Understanding these controls is essential for creatingt robust security programs.
Selecting appropriate controls depends on the organization's risk profile, regulatory environment, and resource availability.
Security professionals must regularly evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and update them as threats evolve.
